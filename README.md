# silver-rel-canary-yard

`silver-rel-canary-yard` is a Solidity project for Reliability. It turns develop a Solidity command-oriented project for canary scenarios with fixture event logs, golden state snapshots, and bounded memory input sets into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Silver Rel Canary Yard

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## Fixture Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Design Sketch

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Solidity project uses Foundry tests and pure contract functions so invariants are cheap to exercise.

## What It Does

- Models failure windows with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep retry budgets changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for runbook checks, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents recovery paths tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `test`: language test directory
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `foundry.toml`: Foundry project configuration

## Next Directions

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more reliability fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Limits

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.
